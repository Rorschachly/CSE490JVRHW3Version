This is the Homework 3 and 4.

I made the task:

o   Import a fish (or other geo) into the scene, 
move the player to the location of this other geo
if the player looks at it for an extended length of time.

o The vignette

o  The audio setup.

The version is Unity 2018.2.20. Open it and play it with an Oculus Rift on.
